# Schwinger-Effect
Code for generating Graphs for the Vacuum transition probability (Pair Production) for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Electro-Axial Theory (QED + Axial field), evaluating the possibilities of constant or dynamical axial field.

There's also some codes for simulating the creation process in the early universe, for a model of universe with primordial Torsion, but this part is a work in progress.
